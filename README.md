# Flat Mates Finder
## Abstract
```
* Accommodation in today’s world has been soaring at high rates. 
* In addition, to get a shelter that matches one’s preference, budget, interest, and proximity is a
challenge. This problem becomes even bigger if the person looking for
accommodation is a student.
* For students, factors like affordability, proximity to the university, similar
company etc. matters the most. 
* There are number of websites and mobile apps that provide facilities for finding suitable roommate and vacant apartment, but as
of now, there is no such mobile app that helps to find roommate or apartment for a specific university.
This application is aimed at trying to solve the major accommodation problem
for university students, bachelors.
This application consists of a variety of features like searching based on
university name and address, potential match based on user’s preferences and
shortlisting.
This Application is developed using React for front end and Mongo DB and Node
JS for backend and we have used various API’s.
